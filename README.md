Ex_1 - elevator - offline algo

-Literature review:
These are links to works that have inspired us to execute the algorithm, given us knowledge regarding problem mapping, object properties, and optimization.

The Elevator Problem - 
detail: 
given N floors in a building, k elevator that we are concerned with and a list of elevator-requests each request comes at a particular time. (source --> destination).
Our goal is to set of a "call" to the elevator. we need to define the goodness of the offline algorithm and to find an algorithm that considerate and answers these problems - 
1.time per request on any floor should be the minimum 
2.the average waiting time per person on any floor should be the minimum.
