Ex_1 - elevator - offline algo

-Literature review:
These are the links that have inspired us to execute the algorithm, given us knowledge regarding problem mapping, object properties, and optimization.

The Elevator Problem - 
details: 
given N floors in a building, k elevator and a list of elevator-requests each request comes at a particular time. (source --> destination).
In the offline algorithm all the input is available to us, and we can use it to write an effecient algorithm.
Our goal is to set of a "call" to the elevator. we need to define the goodness of the offline algorithm and to find an algorithm that considerate and answers these problems - 
1. the average waiting time per person on any floor should be the minimum.
2. miss as little as possible from the given calls.
